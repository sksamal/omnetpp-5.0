<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This file summarizes OMNeT++ changes in each release. For changes related to
simulation model compatibility, see doc/API-Changes. For more detailed info
about all changes, see include/ChangeLog, src/*/ChangeLog, and ide/ChangeLog.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_omnet_5_0_april_2016">OMNeT++ 5.0 (April 2016)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Release 5.0 is a result of development effort of nearly two years. This is a
major release that introduces significant new features compared to the last
4.x version, for example the Canvas API (2D graphics), OpenSceneGraph-based 3D
graphics support, improved logging, a new Qt-based runtime environment that
will eventually replace Tkenv, and much more.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We have also taken the opportunity of the major release to improve several
corners of the OMNeT++ API, and also to get rid of deprecated functionality.
For porting models from OMNeT++ 4.x, see doc/API-changes.txt which lists all
changes, with hints on how to update the model code.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Changes since the release candidate:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Documentation:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Several organizational and rendering improvements on the API documentation
   generated using Doxygen.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The User Manual has been renamed to Simulation Manual to reduce the chance of
   confusing it with the User Guide (which describes the IDE and Tkenv/Qtenv).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improved the contents and the HTML rendering of the Simulation Manual.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
cFigure: skew() methods now take a coefficient instead of an angle.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cOsgCanvas: initialize zNear/zFar to NaN (to indicate they are unset by
   default), and added the mthods setZLimits(), clearZLimits(), hasZLimits().
   Missing zNear/zFar will turn on automatic zNear/zFar computation in the viewer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed a Register_Enum()-related workaround introduced around OMNeT++ 5.0b2
   so that it could compile INET-3.0.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cFingerprint renamed to cFingerprintCalculator.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cKSplit: method rangeExtension(bool) has been renamed to setRangeExtension().
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cModule::size() has been deprecated (use getVectorSize() instead).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Several methods in cComponent, cModule, cSimpleModule, cChannel, cArray,
   cQueue, cTopology, cStatistic and other classes have been made virtual to
   allow the user override them.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix: simtime_t was not part of the omnetpp namespace.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed #943 which prevented using cDatarateChannel&#8217;s forceTransmissionFinishTime()
   method when the channel&#8217;s busy state signal was recorded into an output vector.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Fixed tooltip-related problems: large tooltips could not appear (e.g. the
   help for log prefix in the Preferences dialog); submodule tooltips were
   missing from the canvas
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Qtenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added help to the Log Prefix field in the Preferences dialog and filter
   fields in the Find Objects dialog
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added tooltips to timeline messages
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix: on Windows, Earth scenes appeared distorted in the osg-earth and
   osg-satellites sample simulations
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix: Earth scenes did not display in the osg-intro sample simulation (blank
   viewer window)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Utils:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
opp_featuretool refinements
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Additionally, several bug were fixed in the IDE, Tkenv and Qtenv.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_omnet_5_0_rc1_march_2016">OMNeT++ 5.0 rc1 (March 2016)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This release brings numerous refinements to APIs introduced in previous beta
versions, several bug fixes, and relatively few new features. The manual has
been improved and brought up to date for the most part, although there are
still gaps that will be filled in for the final 5.0 release. The most
conspicuous change will be the new simulation time display in Tkenv and Qtenv.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Build:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Introduced WITH_TKENV, WITH_QTENV, WITH_OSG and WITH_SYSTEMC in configure.user;
   these options allow one to disable certain features if they are not needed.
   In particular, WITH_TKENV=no replaces NO_TCL=1
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The logging API was refined. In addition to several renames (e.g.
   GLOBAL_COMPILETIME_LOGLEVEL was changed to COMPILETIME_LOGLEVEL), the
   numeric order of log level constants (LOGLEVEL_*) was reversed to make
   the values consistent with semantics, and LOGLEVEL_OFF was added to allow
   one completely disable logging. Support for log filtering was added in the
   form of compile-time and runtime predicates. The default compile-time
   log levels were also changed (to TRACE in debug builds, and DETAIL in
   release builds).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the OpenSceneGraph API, OmnetppObjectNode was renamed to cObjectOsgNode.
   Static cOsgCanvas methods that existed for creating and manipulating such
   nodes (createOmnetppObjectNode(), isOmnetppObjectNode(), setOmnetppObject(),
   getOmnetppObject()) were removed, and one should directly use cObjectOsgNode
   instead. Also, the osgutil.h header is now part of omnetpp.h, so it doesn&#8217;t
   need to be included separately.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In cOsgCanvas, the redundant setPerspective() method was removed (it was a
   union of two other setters).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There were several refinements in the cFigure API:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
replaced getClassNameForRenderer() with getRendererClassName()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
spelling: ArrowHead changed to Arrowhead in method names, enum name, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
move() made recursive, nonrecursive version is called moveLocal()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Pixmap: renamed resize() to setSize()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Transform: skew() methods to use coefficient instead of angle
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Transform: the matrix was transposed so points can be column vectors
     instead of row vectors
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
added NUM_GOOD_DARK_COLORS and NUM_GOOD_LIGHT_COLORS
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
some cPixmapFigure methods were also renamed
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Refined @figure syntax, the way figures can be defined in NED files:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
transform= now accepts "( (a b) (c d) (t1 t2) )" and matrix(a,b,c,d,t1,t2)
     syntaxes as well
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
in transform=, scale() now accepts center as well
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
in transform=, skew() now expects coefficient instead of angle
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
arc, rectangle, image, etc to support bounds=x,t,width,height
     as an alternative to the pos=,size=,anchor= triplet
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Revised the configuration options that control recording of @statistics,
   individual scalars, and histograms. As a result, the **.statistic-recording
   and **.bin-recording options were introduced that take over some of the
   responsibility of the formally overloaded **.scalar-recording option.
   Rationale and details in src/envir/ChangeLog.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added cIEventlogManager, a new Envir plugin class that allows one
   to replace the built-in eventlog manager. Eventlog managers are
   responsible for recording simulation history into an eventlog file.
   A new eventlog manager can be activated with the eventlogmanager-class
   configuration option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The cFingerprint class was renamed to cFingerprintCalculator, and the
   fingerprint-class config option to fingerpringcalculator-class.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In cEnvir, renamed getRNGMappingFor(component) to preconfigure(component).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In cSimulation, moved both updating the event number and simulation time
   into executeEvent(). They were updated inconsistently, plus executeEvent()
   is a better place for that than getNextEvent(), considering cScheduler&#8217;s
   putBackEvent().
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed cEnvir::isDisabled() and added cEnvir::isLoggingEnabled(). Renamed
   cEnvir::disableTracing member variable to cEnvir::loggingEnabled.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cModule: size() deprecated, use getVectorSize() instead
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More methods made virtual in cSimpleModule and other classes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improved the descriptions of several per-object config options.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added a large simulation time and event number display to the toolbar that
   display the *current* simulation time (or the time of the last event), as
   opposed to the time of the next event displayed previously. The status bar
   below the toolbar displays information about the *next* event, together with
   the time delta from the current simulation time. Information on the currently
   set up simulation, along with message statistics, have been moved to the
   bottom status bar of the main window.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Qtenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>

<p>
Added a large simulation time and event number display to the toolbar. (This
   is the same GUI change as in Tkenv, see above.)
</p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Cmdenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Configuration options controlling logging in non-express mode
   (cmdenv-express-mode=false) have been simplified. The following options
   have been removed: cmdenv-module-messages, cmdenv-global-log-level,
   **.cmdenv-ev-output. The equivalent functionality (enabling/disabling
   logging and setting the log level globally and per-module) is now
   controlled with **.cmdenv-log-level. Logging can be disabled with
   **.cmdenv-log-level = OFF. Note that the cmdenv-event-banners and
   cmdenv-log-prefix options still exist.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The cmdenv-message-trace configuration option has been removed. It had very
   limited usefulness, and it was somewhat overlapping with eventlog.
</p>
</li>

<h2 id="_omnet_5_0_beta_3_december_2015">OMNeT++ 5.0 beta 3 (December 2015)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The highlights of this release are the experimental version of Qtenv (which is
a Qt-based runtime environment that will eventually replace Tkenv), support
for 3D graphics using OpenSceneGraph, and the addition of the much-requested
opp_featuretool utility. The full list follows:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Use of the omnetpp namespace was made permanent. The recommended way of
   porting models is to add the "using namespace omnetpp;" like to header
   files. To compile models without change, add -DAUTOIMPORT_OMNETPP_NAMESPACE
   to the compiler command line.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added 3D graphics support via OpenSceneGraph. The 3D scene graph is to
   be built using the OpenSceneGraph API (e.g. loaded from file via
   osgDB::readNodeFile()), and then set onto a cOsgCanvas instance. 3D scene(s)
   can be visualized in the new Qtenv runtime GUI. (There is no 3D support
   in Tkenv, due to technical limitations.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added resolveResourcePath() to cEnvir and cComponent. The method searches
   a number of folders for a resource given with its file name or relative
   path, and returns the path for the first match. It can useful for locating
   various data files for models, OSG model files, and other files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Visualization: added a method to the base class of modules and channels to
   serve as a container of visualization-related code. refreshDisplay() is
   invoked by graphical user interfaces (Qtenv, Tkenv) whenever GUI contents
   need to be refreshed. Display string updates, canvas figures maintenance,
   and OSG scene graph updates are probably best done inside refreshDisplay()
   methods, as it can result in significant performance gain and, in some
   cases, also in more consistent information being displayed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
An isExpressMode() method has been added to cEnvir to query whether the
   simulation runs in Express mode under a GUI. This information can be useful
   additional input for refreshDisplay() code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The simtime-scale config option has been replaced by simtime-resolution,
   a more user-friendly incarnation. simtime-resolution accepts time units
   (s, ms, us, ns, ps, fs, as), power-of-ten multiples of such a unit (e.g.
   100ms), and also base-10 scale exponents in the -18..0 range (mostly for
   backward compatibility with simtime-scale).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
RNG-to-module mapping made more flexible: the *.rng-&lt;N&gt; config option now
   allows expressions, including those containing index, parentIndex, and
   ancestorIndex(level). This change allows things like assigning a separate
   RNG to each element of a module vector.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fingerprint computation has changed. It was also made more flexible,
   e.g. it is now possible to control which ingredients are added into the
   fingerprint computation. Define USE_OMNETPP4x_FINGERPRINT at compile-time
   to get back OMNeT++ 4.x fingerprints.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Signal listener interface change: A cObject *details argument has been
   added to emit() methods to allow simulation models provide extra information
   with primitive data types (double, long, etc) they emit, without the need
   to switch over to emitting cObject altogether. This is a non-backward-
   compatible change: signal listeners will need to be updated with the extra
   argument. To facilitate transition, you can compile OMNeT++ and models with
   WITH_OMNETPP4x_LISTENER_SUPPORT defined; this will set up cIListener
   to delegate to the old methods, so existing listeners will work.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Result filter/recorder interfaces, being based on signal listeners, have
   undergone a similar change. Models containing custom result filters or
   recorders will need to be updated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
SimTime overhaul to increase accuracy (i.e. use integer arithmetic
   where possible), improve the API, and add missing operations/functions.
   Details:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added missing * and / operators for integral types. This causes
     integer multiplications/divisions to be computed with integer arithmetic
     instead of floating point, resulting in better accuracy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added overflow checking for integer multiplication and negation
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use int64 arithmetic and overflow checking when assigning from integer types
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added isZero()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Replaced "int exponent" with "SimTimeUnit unit" in the two-argument
     constructor (value + unit) and several other methods, with the aim
     of making the API more user-friendly (and model code easier to read).
     Models that call affected methods with integers will need to be
     updated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Moved math functions like fabs(SimTime) into the omnetpp namespace
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added div(SimTime, SimTime); also refined related fmod()'s documentation
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed SIMTIME_RAW(), STR_SIMTIME(), and SIMTIME_TTOA(). These macros are
   no longer needed, as were introduced in OMNeT++ 4.0 to assist porting models
   from version 3.x where simulation time was stored in double. Also, MAXTIME
   was renamed to SIMTIME_MAX.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The tkenv-image-path config option has been replaced with image-path.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
NOTE: The above descriptions have been edited for brevity. More information
   is available in the ChangeLog files (e.g. include/omnetpp/ChangeLog and
   src/sim/ChangeLog), and in doc/API-changes.txt.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Qtenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Qtenv, the Qt-based runtime environment is currently in preview status,
   Tkenv is still the default runtime. Qtenv can be activated by adding the
   '-u Qtenv' switch to simulation command lines. Alternatively, specify
   'PREFER_QTENV=yes' in configure.user to make Qtenv the default GUI.
   Note that 3D visualization is only available in Qtenv.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>SystemC:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Updated the bundled SystemC reference implementation to version 2.3.1
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Examples:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Several new examples (osg-intro, osg-earth, osg-indoor, osg-satellites) have
   been added to the 'samples' folder to demonstrate the new 3D visualization
   capabilities in Qtenv.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Aloha has been updated to use the new refreshDisplay() method.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tools:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added 'opp_featuretool', which is basically the command-line equivalent of
   the Project Features dialog in the IDE: it allows one to enable/disable
   project features defined for an OMNeT++ project, e.g. the INET Framework.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Build:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Because of the new Qtenv runtime environment, OMNeT++ now has several additional
   dependencies: Qt4 is mandatory, while OpenSceneGraph and osgEarth is optional.
   Qtenv can be fully disabled by commenting out the QT_VERSION= variable in the
   configure.user file and then re-running ./configure. Building Qtenv without
   the OpenSceneGraph libraries will disable 3D visualization support in Qtenv.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A separate Mac OS X specific installation bundle was created that contains
   the binary files for all the external dependencies (Tcl/Tk, Qt, OSG, osgEarth etc.)
   As a consequence you no longer have to manually install Quartz before installing
   OMNeT++. We have now separate installation bundles for Linux/Mac/Windows.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The bundled toolchain on Windows has been updated to use MinGW-w64 (32-bit)
   containing both the 'gcc' and 'clang' compilers. The bundle contains all the
   dependencies needed to build OMNeT++ (including Tcl/Tk, Qt4, OpenSceneGraph,
   osgEarth etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Because of the large size of the extra dependencies (Qt, OpenSceneGraph), the
   tools directory is now distributed as a highly compressed archive file inside
   the Windows installation bundle. It is extracted to its final location when
   mingwenv.cmd is first started.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
On systems that have both the 'gcc' and 'clang' compilers installed, OMNeT++
   will pick 'clang' by default. This behavior can be changed by the PREFER_CLANG
   variable in the configure.user file.
</p>
</li>

<h2 id="_omnet_5_0_beta_2_july_2015">OMNeT++ 5.0 beta 2 (July 2015)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
OMNeT++ classes are now in the "omnetpp" namespace. Models need to be
    modified to compile, e.g. by adding "using namespace omnetpp" or
    USING_NAMESPACE lines at appropriate places. (The latter conditionally
    expands to the former when needed, and to the empty string when not,
    making your code compatible with OMNeT++ 4.6 too.) If you don&#8217;t want to
    change the model source code, you can define the AUTOIMPORT_NAMESPACE
    macro on the compiler command line (add -DAUTOIMPORT_NAMESPACE to
    CFLAGS), which will basically add the using namespace directive at the
    end of &lt;omnetpp.h&gt;. Turning off the omnetpp namespace (by setting USE_NAMESPACE=no in
    configure.user) is no longer fully supported, and will be removed
    in the next beta.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Introduced cRandom, which encapsulates a random number stream into an
   object. Random numbers can be extracted with the draw() method.
   Added the following cRandom subclasses: cUniform, cExponential,
   cNormal, cTruncNormal, cGamma, cBeta, cErlang, cChiSquare, cStudentT,
   cCauchy, cTriang, cWeibull, cParetoShifted, cIntUniform, cBernoulli,
   cBinomial, cGeometric, cNegBinomial, cPoisson. They encapsulate the
   similarly named functions (e.g. exponential()) with their parameters
   and the random number generator (cRNG). cStatistic also now subclasses
   from cRandom: it can generate a random variate from the distribution
   observed in the collected sample.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Random variate generation functions (normal(), etc.) signature change:
   the trailing "int rng" (RNG index of context module) argument was changed
   to cRNG*, and moved to the front. Motivation: break the functions'
   dependence on the context module. However, to lessen the impact of the signature change, random variate
   generation functions with their original signatures have been added
   to cComponent as methods. Thus, models that only use those functions from
   module methods will not notice any change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The interface of iterators (GateIterator, SubmoduleIterator and
   ChannelIterator in cModule, cQueue::Iterator, etc.) have been changed
   to make them more consistent with STL iterators. Therefore, operator()
   as a means of dereferencing has been deprecated, and operator* and
   operator-&gt; have been added instead. The increment/decrement operators
   have also been revised.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FES made replaceable. To this end, an abstract cFutureEventSet base class
   has been introduced, and cMessageHeap (now renamed cEventHeap) was made
   to extend cFutureEventSet. An accessor method (cFutureEventSet* getFES())
   has been added to cSimulation, and the older members msgQueue and
   getMessageQueue() have been removed. Simulations now accept a
   'futureeventset-class=&lt;classname&gt;' configuration option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Further refinement of the new canvas API (cCanvas and cFigure + subclasses)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The "simulation" and "ev" macros have been removed, to reduce pollution
   of the global namespace. You can use the newly introduced getSimulation()
   and getEnvir() functions instead.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cObject::parsimPack() has become const. You only need to pay attention
   (and add "const" manually) if you have classes that redefine parsimPack().
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cQueue and cMessageHeap had both length()/getLength() and empty()/isEmpty()
   methods; the former have been removed; use getLength() and isEmpty() instead.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There have been several other, smaller changes and improvements in many
   classes, e.g. cException, cStatistic, cDensityEstBase, cObjectFactory, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Most methods, typedefs and other items deprecated in previous versions have
   been removed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
See doc/API-changelog.txt for a complete list of changes.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>NED:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Allow a "module" to extend a "simple" (motivation: INET 3.x)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The message compiler no longer appends "_var" to the names of data members
   in generated classes. In cases where this change breaks existing code
   (classes with @customize(true) or with subclasses), you can emulate the
   old behavior by adding the following to the message definition:
   '@fieldNameSuffix("_var");'
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In message compiler generated code, doPacking() has been renamed to
   doParsimPacking(), doUnpacking() to doParsimUnpacking().
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Feature: double-clicking a module in the object tree will open it
   in the main area instead of opening a new inspector window. A new
   inspector can still be opened from the context menu.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added the "Hide namespaces" option in the Preferences dialog that turns off
   the display of the namespace part of C&#x2060;+&#x2060;+ class names when they appear in
   the GUI.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Images under images/old/ are no longer accessible without the "old/"
   prefix, so if you use such an icon, you must add the "old/" prefix
   manually for them to continue to work. For example, you have to change
   "i=cloud" to "i=old/cloud" in display strings. The feature to let old/*
   images be accessible without the prefix was originally introduced to ease
   the transition from OMNeT++ 3.x to 4.0.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Several bug fixes
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>General:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The include/ folder was restructured: only the public header &lt;omnetpp.h&gt; was
   left in it, all other include files were moved into an omnetpp/ subfolder
   under include/.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The source tree (src/) has gone through several modernizing and cleanup steps:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Per-folder nested namespaces have been introduced, e.g. Tkenv code is now
     in the omnetpp::tkenv namespace.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Qualified includes with the folder, i.e. #include "stringutil.h" became
     #include "common/stringutil.h". This increases readability and reduces
     the chance of including a wrong header.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use fully qualified header guards
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Modernizing: use the 'nullptr' and 'override' keywords; use C&#x2060;+&#x2060;+ names of C
     headers (e.g. &lt;cstdio&gt; instead of &lt;stdio.h&gt;).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Code style: renamed many identifiers (local variables, arguments, private
     data members, etc.) to have a consistent, camelcase naming); codebase
     reformatted to have a consistent indentation style.

<h2 id="_omnet_5_0_beta_1_feb_2015">OMNeT++ 5.0 beta 1 (Feb 2015)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added the Canvas API, a figure-based 2D drawing API. The Canvas API allows
   augmenting simulations with graphical elements. Item types include various
   shapes, text and image, including an SVG-like "path" item (a generalized
   polygon/polyline, with arcs and Bezier curves). Transformations (scaling,
   rotation, skewing) are supported, as well as transparency.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New logging API. It features six log levels (FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO,
   DETAIL, DEBUG, TRACE), category support, compile-time and runtime global
   and per-module log level thresholds.
   Also, much more information is passed with each log line to the user
   interface code, allowing one to display a wealth of information in the log
   prefix (log level, file/line, event number, simulation time, module name
  and type, object name and type, and so on).
Incompatibilities:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
lower-case ev&lt;&lt; is no longer legal, use EV&lt;&lt; instead
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ev.printf() was removed, use the stream API (EV&lt;&lt;) instead
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Introduced cEvent as a base class of cMessage. cEvent allows scheduling
   of arbitrary code for a simulation time that runs independent of modules.
   Override the execute() method of cEvent to specify the code. cEvent is
   not intended for use in simulation models; the primary motivation is to
   allow implementing simulation time limit with an "end-simulation" event,
   and to encapsulate foreign events (e.g. SystemC events and crunching)
   for seamless integration with the simulation event loop.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added support for simulation lifecycle listeners. Listeners are called back
   before and after network setup, on network initialization, before and after
   network finalization, and so on. The motivation was to allow more flexibility
   when writing initialization and shutdown code for schedulers, result
   file managers and other extensions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Channel objects made equal to modules in the sense that now they also have
   IDs (the getId() method was moved from cModule to cComponent, the common base
   class of modules and channels), and they are also registered with cSimulation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cTopology improvements:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
added factory methods for links and edges
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
added methods to manipulate the graph (e.g. build a graph from scratch)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed int8..int64 and uint8..uint64. Models should use the standard integer
   types from &lt;stdint.h&gt; that end in "_t": int8_t, uint8_t, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
check_and_cast&lt;&gt; improved; added check_and_cast_nullable&lt;&gt; that accepts NULL
   pointer as input
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New fingerprint computation algorithm. The goal was to make the fingerprint
   less sensitive to uninteresting changes (e.g. removal of an inactive module),
   and more sensitive to interesting ones (e.g. change in packet lengths).
   To get the old fingerprints, define USE_OMNETPP4x_FINGERPRINTS when compiling
   OMNeT++.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cClassDescriptor interface changes (method renaming and arg list changes)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Code cleanup, including:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
removal of 3.x backward compatibility features (WITH_DOUBLE_SIMTIME,
     WITHOUT_CPACKET)
</p>

removal of deprecated classes, functions and macros (cLinkedList,
     cSimulation::operator[], Define_Function(), etc.)
</p>

</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The bgs (background scaling) display string tag has been removed. It was
   originally introduced more or less as a default zoom level, but lost its
   significance since interactive zoom has been introduced.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Zooming no longer affects icon sizes on the screen (but you still have
   the Increase/Decrease Icon Size, Ctrl+I/Ctrl+O menu items in Tkenv).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finished implementation of the Canvas API Tkenv rendering. The
   implementation is based on figure renderers (see FigureRenderer class)
   that can be registered for various figure classes.
   The implementation is based on the Tkpath Tcl/Tk extension, which was
   significantly enhanced by our team.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tkpath is now also used internally for drawing submodules, connections
   and the like. Benefits include:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
unlimited zooming of image backgrounds
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
antialiased drawing (Tk canvas didn&#8217;t have antialiasing)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
OS X: images are no longer forced into 1-bit transparency
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
labels are now outlined (have a "halo") to make them readable on noisy backgrounds
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
range indicator fill is now semi-transparent (because Tkpath supports that)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
performance improvements e.g. on OS X, and with image backgrounds
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Display log prefix; log prefix format and log level configurable via the Options dialog
</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<p>IMPORTANT:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>To install OMNEST on OS X, you must install both the Apple Java
    support package (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572) and (Oracle) JDK 1.7
    or later (from http://java.com).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tkenv:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improved zooming/panning support: use double click to zoom in around
    a point, and Shift + double click to zoom out; use Ctrl + left mouse
    button to drag out a rectangle to zoom to (a.k.a. marquee zoom;
    implementation based on patch from Christoph Sommer), right-click
    cancels marquee zoom; use left mouse button for panning</p></li>

<li><p>Further small UI fixes (see ChangeLog)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Core:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>The testing tool opp_test has been revised and is now an official part
    of OMNEST.</p></li>

<li><p>The Manual now has a new chapter that covers the testing of simulation
    models as well as the usage of the opp_test tool.</p></li>

<li><p>The message compiler opp_msgc was reimplemented as a part of nedtool.
    opp_msgc still exists as a wrapper script that points to nedtool.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>IDE:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The IDE is now based on Eclipse 4.4 Luna, and requires JDK 1.7 or later.</p></li>

<li><p>The IDE is now a 64-bit application on Mac OS X.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>OMNEST is now using C++11 by default (-std=c++11) when models are compiled.
    The simulator itself does not use any of the C++11 features, so C++11 support may
    be disabled in configure.user. Update your models to compile properly using the
    C++11 standard, as later OMNEST versions will require C++11 compliance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>OMNEST can be configured to use the 'omnetpp' namespace by setting
    USE_NAMESPACE=yes in configure.user</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clang compiler support: Clang is used by default on OS X, and can be turned
    on on Linux. Clang is still not supported on Windows (we are waiting for the
    MSYS Clang packages to mature).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bundled MSYS/MinGW toolchain was updated to use MSYS2. MSYS2 resolves
    a number of issues:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>No more memory errors during build</p></li>
    <li><p>The make command now properly supports parallel build (-j4, -j8 etc.)</p></li>
    <li><p>The bundled MSYS2 toolchain now contains the pacman package manager,
        so you can install additional packages if you wish</p></li>
    <li><p>Change in OMNEST: The msys/ directory has been moved to tools/win32/ while
        the mingw/ directory that contains the compiler has been moved to
        tools/win32/mingw32/.</p></li>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Sim:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
    Support for optional signal checking. When signal checking is turned on,
    signals emitted by modules/channels must be declared with a @signal property
    in the module&#8217;s or channel&#8217;s NED description; undeclared signals will result
    in a runtime error. Signal declarations are of the form
</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>@signal[&lt;signalName&gt;](type=&lt;dataType&gt;);</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&lt;signalName&gt; may contain wildcards (?,*). Type is optional; if present,
data type can be long, unsigned long, double, simtime_t, string, or a
registered class name. To allow NULL pointers, append a question mark to
the class name. Example:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>@signal[receivedPk](type=cPacket?);</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This feature is controlled by the check-signals=&lt;bool&gt; configuration
option, and it is turned off by default for now.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Support for @statistic-style declarative result recording on dynamically
    registered signals (e.g. "conn-&lt;n&gt;" where n is an integer). Instead of
    @statistic, add a @statisticTemplate property in the NED file, and for
    each new signal call ev.addResultRecorders(...).
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Support for programmatically adding result filters and recorders on
    signals: cResultRecorder has been revised to allow result recorders
    to be used without a corresponding @statistic attribute, e.g. they
    can now be added to signals programmatically.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Further signals-related changes:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
added emit(simsignal_t, const cObject*) to cComponent
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
added receiveSignal() overload for bool to cIListener
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
introduced SimsignalType which replaces the older cITimestampedValue::Type
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
added cObjectFactory::isInstance() method that effectively wraps a
      dynamic_cast
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
added Register_Abstract_Class() macro that allows abstract classes to be
      used in signal declarations as type.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added cNEDValue::parseQuantity()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New result filter: removeRepeats
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Feature: Just-in-time debugging support.
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
new configuration options: <em>debugger-attach-on-startup</em>, <em>debugger-attach-on-error</em>,
        <em>debugger-attach-command</em>, <em>debugger-attach-wait-time</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the simulation kernel can invoke the debugger on an error (or on startup)
        using the command-line specified by the <em>debugger-attach-command</em> option.

</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>NED:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
More freedom in NED property syntax: (1) Hyphens, dots and colons are now
    allowed in property names and indices; and (2) values no longer need
    to be enclosed in quotes if they contain parens, provided that parens are
    balanced.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Feature: "Debug Next Event" (Ctrl+F9). It causes the simulation program
    to stop in the debugger just before entering the handleMessage() call.
</p>

<li>
<p>
Fixes and workarounds for various issues on Mac OS X (poor animation speed,
    missing icons on OS X Mavericks, hang on the F5 key, etc.)
</p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Use Eclipse 4.3 as base platform
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for project-specific images: icons from the "images/" folder of the
    project and its dependencies are automatically used by the NED editor, and
    added to the Tkenv image path when the simulation is launched. (The folder
    name is currently hardcoded; it will become configurable in future versions.)

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added proper support for cross-compilation using ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32

    from MacPorts, and digitally sign it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
IDE: fixed the launcher not to throw error if the toolchain is clang.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The IDE was made more friendly to first-time users:</p></div>


<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
When the IDE is started with an empty workspace (e.g. on first-time
launch), it offers the user the following options: (1) Import the OMNeT++
sample simulations into the workspace; and (2) Download and install the
INET Framework.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The latter function is also available via the Help > Install Simulation
Models... menu item. The menu item brings up a dialog with the list of
simulation models available for automated installation, and lets the user
choose. Currently only the INET Framework is listed there, but it is
planned to add further models.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When the IDE is started for the first time, it now displays some helpful
introductory pages in the editor area: "Getting Started" (practical
advice for getting past the first 10 minutes spent in the IDE);
"At a Glance" (explains the common file types like NED, msg and ini, and
their purposes); "OMNeT++ Samples" (describes each example simulation in
two sentences, then provides links for opening the project, viewing the
README, launching the simulation, etc.) These pages are also available
from the Help system (except the last one, which has a dedicated menu item
under the Help menu.)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Further IDE improvements:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
IDE launcher script: fixed #670 (vmargs conflict between omnetpp.ini and

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Documentation:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Revised and significantly expanded the "C++ Development" chapter in the
    User Guide to better assist model developers; smaller improvements in
    other chapters
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tools:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Updated MSYS and MinGW binaries in the Windows distribution.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The build system now creates 64-bit binaries on Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7
    (if your processor supports it). Previously the -m32 flag was added to
    the GCC command line to force the creation of 32-bit binaries. (This
    was necessary because earlier versions of CDT did not support 64-bit
    debugging).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Enabled pretty-printing of variables in gdb (see below)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Better C++ debugging experience: std::string, std::vector, std::map and
    other standard classes as well as simtime_t are now displayed in a
    meaningful way; simulation objects (cObject) display their full paths.
    This functionality is enabled by gdb pretty printer extensions written
    in Python, and is thus available for command-line gdb debugging too.
    For activating the pretty printers, see misc/gdb/README.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
NED documentation generator improvements: better-looking tables in the
    generated documentation; running Doxygen is now cancellable; etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dropped PowerPC support for the IDE because Mac OS X 10.7 no longer
    supports this architecture.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sim:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all classes. Now they
    delegate to the same function in the super class, and the common
    part of the two is factored out to private copy() functions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed all warnings to make it compile using -Wall -Werror.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Coroutines used for 'activities' are now implemented using the
swapcontext() POSIX call (if it is available on the system).
</p>
</li>

</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sample simulations:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Database example revived. It demonstrates using database as configuration
    source, as storage for output scalars and vectors, and as source of
    network topology. Currently it works with MySQL.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Countless bug fixes and smaller improvements.</p></div>

<h2 id="_omnet_4_2rc1_aug_2011">OMNeT++ 4.2rc1 (Aug 2011)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ini files:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Ini files: iterations (${&#8230;}) can now refer to other iteration variables,
   improvement makes it possible to have loops where the inner iteration range
   depends on the outer one. When needed, the default top-down nesting order
   of iteration loops is modified (loops are reordered) to ensure that
   expressions only refer to more outer loop variables, but not to inner ones.
   When this is not possible, an error is generated with the "circular
   dependency" message. Variables are substituted textually, and the text
   resulting from substitution is NOT evaluated except in the '&lt;from&gt;..&lt;to&gt;
   step &lt;step&gt;' syntax, and in the 'constraint=' ini file option. CAUTION:
   textual substitution means that variables in arithmetic expressions should
   be protected with parentheses. The text substitution model was chosen for
   greater flexibility as well as the ability to produce a more consistent
   semantics. See src/envir/ChangeLog for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Incompatible change: In the constraint= configuration option, variables now
   be surrounded with parens (to ensure precedence after the textual variable
   substitution). For example, the expression x+y&lt;10 must be changed to
   $x+$y&lt;10, or for greater safety, to ($x)+($y)&lt;10.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Parallel iteration: it is now supported to use named iteration
   variables and parallel iteration together ($&#8230;!bar syntax.)
   This was not supported previously.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Some iteration-related error messages have been improved to provide
   more context.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sim:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Result filter/recorder interfaces and registration macros made public
   (moved to src/sim), so that users can contribute their own result filters
   and recorders. Files: cresultlistener.h, cresultfilter.h  cresultrecorder.h.
   Result filters have to be subclassed from cResultFilter or the more specific
   cNumericResultFilter or cObjectResultFilter base classes and registered with
   the Register_ResultFilter() macro; result recorders have to be subclassed
   from cResultRecorder or the more specific cNumericResultRecorder, and
   registered with the Register_ResultRecorder() macro. After that, the new
   filter or recorder can be used in the source= and record= attributes of
   @statistic, and with the **.result-recording-modes configuration option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Define_Function() macros have been renamed to Define_NED_Math_Function().
   For backwards compatibility, the old macro definitions remain, but issue
   a deprecation warning. Note that the preferred way of defining new NED
   functions is now the Define_NED_Function() macro.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The API for custom NED functions defined via Define_NED_Function() has been
   changed. cDynamicExpression::Value (the old value class) has been factored
   out to a new cNEDValue class. Data members are no longer public, they can
   be manipulated via various methods. NOTE: This change is NOT backwards
   compatible: user-supplied NED functions will need to be revised.
   Look at src/sim/nedfunctions.cc for code examples.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Measurement unit support: added "mps" (m/s) and "kmph" (km/h) as recognized
   units; changed "Kbps" to more standards compilant "kbps"; changed byte
   multiples notation to use the now-standard IEC binary prefixes: KB -&gt; KiB,
   MB -&gt; MiB, GB -&gt; GiB, TB -&gt; TiB. The latter changes affect backwards
   compatibility, i.e. you may need to update existing models.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tools:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
opp_run: bugfix: release-mode simulation models compiled as shared libraries
   could not be run using a debug-mode opp_run program (they either crashed
   or reported that a module was not registered with the Register_Module()
   macro.) As part of the fix, a new opp_run_release program has been
   introduced, and opp_run (which is now always compiled as debug) delegates
   to it when necessary.
      Due to makefile changes related to the fix, you may need to re-create the
   makefiles of your simulation when upgrading to OMNeT++ 4.2. (You only need
   to do that when working on the command line. The IDE automatically recreates
   the makefiles, so no action is needed on your part if you are using only the
   IDE.) See src/envir/ChangeLog for details of this change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Implemented number filter expressions using multiple inputs for statistics source
   expressions. For example:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>@statistic[dropRate](source="count(packetDropped)/count(packetSent)");</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
opp_msgc: improvement: announcements and type definitions now observe
   whether they are above the namespace declaration (=outside the namespace)
   or below it (=inside the namespace). This change makes it consistent with
   cplusplus blocks that had this behavior for quite some time. A related
   improvement is that type lookup in namespaces has been modified to make it
   possible to use unqualified names when declaring fields. See
   src/nedxml/ChangeLog for details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Akaroa support improved; samples/aloha/akaroa.ini was added as example
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Documentation:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Several chapters in the User Manual have been updated; especially, the
   Message Definitions section was turned into a separate chapter, and
   was completely revised.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Upgraded to Eclipse 3.7
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added Eclipse Marketplace to the Help menu. You can now install
   additional features from the market.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Before running the simulations, the IDE will show the command line in
   the console view to help you execute the same simulation from the
   command line.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ctrl-Tab now works on freshly opened NED files even if you do not explicitly
   select a simple module. In that case, the IDE opens the .h and .cc files
   associated with the first simple module in the NED file.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvement on the Manage Build Configurations dialog: newly created build
   configurations are now configured, by copying the source entries from one
   of the existing build configurations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Project Makemake Options property page: overhaul for better usability.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Documentation generator: turn on JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF in newly generated
   doxy.cfg files. (When this option is on, there is no need for @brief
   in C++ doxy comments; instead the first sentence of the comment is taken
   automatically as brief description.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bug fixes on: IDE makefile generator; the Project Features feature;
   the Inifile Editor (hover info, content assist, etc); the NED editor
   (display string proposals for connections and channels, etc.); Organize
   Imports feature; NED documentation generator; Simulation Launcher (e.g.
   launching folders with simulations in them works again);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
SVN support removed from the IDE. It had very few users, and can be
   installed from the Market if needed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed Animation Player as it was only a "technology preview" bundled
   with the beta releases to gather feedback from the user community. The
   animator is scheduled to appear in the next major OMNeT++ release.

<h2 id="_omnet_4_2b2_may_2011">OMNeT++ 4.2b2 (May 2011)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Most important feature: "Project Features" (see below).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>NED:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added support for conditional submodules. Syntax:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>udp: UDP if needsUDP {...}
tcp: &lt;tcpType&gt; like ITCP if needsTCP {...}</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added the xml() NED function, which accepts a string argument and parses
   it as XML. Its most notable use is eliminating "empty.xml" files from INET:
   one can use xml("&lt;root/&gt;") in NED files instead.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Implemented default value for parametric submodule and channel types.
   NED now supports the following syntax:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>mobility: &lt;default("NullMobility")&gt; like IMobility;</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<p>The effect is that the NullMobility NED type will be used for the mobility
submodule if the type name is not specified otherwise, e.g. in the config-
uration with something like</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>**.mobility.type-name = "ConstSpeedMobility"</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added the firstAvailable() NED function, which is helpful with the Project
   Features feature (see below). It accepts any number of strings (see new
   varargs support for NED functions), interprets them as NED type names
   (either short names or fully qualified names), and returns the first one
   that exists and is also "available" (its C++ implementation class exists).
   Example usage:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>tcp: &lt;default(firstAvailable("TCP_lwIP", "TCP_NSC", "TCP"))&gt; {..}</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<p>It chooses the TCP_lwIP, TCP_NSC or TCP module type for the tcp submodule,
in this order, unless the type is explicitly defined to be something else
in the configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Parametric submodule type can now also be specified in NED files, using
   patterns that end in the new "typename" keyword. An example:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>network Net {
    parameters:
        host[*].tcp.typename = "TCP_lwIP";
    ...
}</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ini files:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The "type-name" per-object configuration option (**.typename=) has been
   renamed in to "typename", for consistency with the similar new NED feature.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sim:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Implemented varargs support for NED functions. If the signature (see
   Define_NED_Function() and Define_NED_Function2() macros) ends in ", &#8230;",
   then the function will accept any number of additional arguments of any type.
   At runtime, the implementation has access to both the actual number and
   types of args. When passing extra args, optional arguments (those marked
   with '?' in the signature) must all be present, i.e. varargs can only come
   when all typed args are there.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Upgraded to Eclipse 3.6.2
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Implemented the "Project Features" feature, which makes it possible to
   disable unused parts ("features") of a project to reduce compilation time
   and complexity. It has been invented to help INET Framework users and
   developers deal with the growing size of the framework. Features are
   described in the project&#8217;s .oppfeatures file, authored by INET developers.
   Users can activate/deactivate features in the Project Features page of
   the Project Properties dialog (this page is directly accessible from the
   Project menu and from the Build Configurations submenu of the project&#8217;s
   context menu in Project Explorer). Features map to NED packages and C++
   source folders; disabling a feature maps to NED package exclusion, and
   folder exclusion in CDT (C++ Development) configuration. Features can also
   define C/C++ symbols (for #ifdefs), and extra libraries to link with.
   At build time, the IDE checks the project&#8217;s configuration (NED, CDT) and
   if it is inconsistent with the selected features, it offers fixing it.
   Features can also be used from the command line by exporting Makefiles
   (or opp_makemake commands) that reflect a particular enablement of features.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for excluding (disabling) NED packages. This feature is needed for
   the Project Features feature. Exclusions can be edited on the NED Source
   Folders project property page, and are saved into the project&#8217;s .nedfolders
   file.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Animation Player:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Implemented lazy loading of the eventlog file: the tool can now animate
   large eventlog files with acceptable performance.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Animation effects refined, e.g. packet transmission on a datarate channel.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Heavy bugfixing. Note that the tool is still being actively developed, and
   it is generally not yet ready for everyday use.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Inifile Editor:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Usability: the editor now comes up with the page (text or form) that was
   used last time, and not always with the form editor. (When you flip the
   editor to the other page, the page type is stored in the preferences.
   When an editor is opened, the setting is read from the preferences and
   the corresponding page is activated.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improved text hover (F2) and hyperlink (Ctrl+click) support: the editor
   can now show information and go to the definition of modules that occur
   in the inifile key. For example, for a **.host[*].tcp.sackSupport = true
   line, the user can hover over (or Ctrl+click) the host[*] part, and the
   editor will show relevant information and go to the definition of the
   host[] submodule vector in the NED network description.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improved content assist: per-object configuration options are now filtered
   by the type of object that the key refers to; for example, if you type
   **.ppp[*].txPkBytes.&lt;Ctrl+Space&gt;, the editor will know from the NED files
   that txPkBytes is a statistic, and offer completions accordingly.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Content assist: different types of completions (modules, parameters,
   statistics, configuration options, etc) are now marked with icons.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Markers on included inifiles are now removed when the main inifile is
   closed. (Fix for #176)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added the Copy action to the Module Parameters view context menu: you can
   now select the key for an unassigned parameter in the view, and copy/paste
   it into the editor area.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Wizards:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
New Tictoc Example and New Source-Sink Example wizards: fix: the root
   Makefile executed opp_makemake in the src/ folder at each build,
   overwriting the IDE-generated Makefile.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New OMNeT++ Project wizard template: now it is possible to set "custom make"
   for a folder: specify &lt;foldername&gt;:CUSTOM in the makemakeOptions= template
   variable in template.properties. Use "." to name the project root folder.
   Example: makemakeOptions = .: CUSTOM, src: --deep -meta:recurse&#8230;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New option for template.properties: preRunTemplate=&lt;fti-file-name&gt;. Example:
   preRunTemplate = main.fti. The option causes the given template file to be
   evaluated for its side effects, just after the user hits Finish but before
   any file is copied or template is evaluated. It is not allowed to produce
   text output, but the variables it sets will be substituted into other
   template.properties variables, and will also be available in other template
   files. (Note: all other templates are run in isolation, and cannot change
   variables for other templates!) The preRunTemplate option is the only way
   to programmatically set the value of makemakeOptions and similar
   template.properties options.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Graphical Editor:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Switched back double-click behavior to Open NED Type action. The Properties
   dialog can now opened with Ctrl+Enter (Alt+Enter was unavailable.)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Sequence Chart and Event Log:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added show/hide options for arrows that represent mixed dependencies.
   (Such arrows are drawn when the sequence chart is filtered, and represent
   e.g. a sequence of message sendings and self-messages)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Eventlog: enhanced performance of event tracing filter
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Simulations now record the termination message and result code into the
   eventlog file
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Note: eventlog file format has changed (in order to better serve the
   Animation Tool)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;.elog files recorded with any prior version of OMNeT++
   have to be re-recorded.
</p>
</li>

<h2 id="_omnet_4_2b1_feb_2011">OMNeT++ 4.2b1 (Feb 2011)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Partial list of changes since 4.1 (see ChangeLog files in individual folders
for a more complete list):</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Simulation runtime:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Removed #include &lt;winsock.h&gt; from &lt;platdep/timeutil.h&gt;; the reason
   is that it conflicted with lwIP code recently integrated into INET.
   &lt;platdep/sockets.h&gt; still includes &lt;winsock.h&gt;, but now
   &lt;platdep/sockets.h&gt; (and &lt;platdep/timeutil.h&gt;) MUST precede &lt;omnetpp.h&gt;
   in all source files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ini files: implemented multiple inheritance for sections. Syntax:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>[Config Foobar]
extends = Foo, Bar</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<p>When the runtime looks for a config option or param assignment, sections
are examined in a "fallback order" until the first match is found. In the
above example the order would be: Foobar, Foo, Bar, General.
OMNeT++ uses C3 linearization to compute the section fallback order,
see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ini files: better parsing for iteration variables, e.g. the value in
   $uniform(1,2) is now parsed as one item, not as "uniform(1" and "2)".
   Nested parens/brackets/braces and string literals are recognized;
   escaping commas and close-braces is now possible using backslash.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
NED: fixed deep parameter assignments: parameter references were
   interpreted in the wrong context. Deep parameter assignments are when
   an inifile-like pattern is used to name the parameter(s) to be set, as in:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>network Inet {
    parameters:
        host[*].tcp.nagleEnabled = true;
    ...
}</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Resolved spurious errors: 'Class "&#8230;" not found&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;perhaps its code
   was not linked in, or the class wasn&#8217;t registered with Register_Class()'
   Added a check to ensure that the debug and the release versions of
   the simulation library are not loaded at the same time. This problem
   occurred when a model was built as 'release' and the debug version of
   'opp_run' was used to start it. As a result, the simulation seemingly
   started but complained about missing classes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix: Some classes were thrown out by the linker if OMNeT++ was statically
   built, and the simulation was complaining at runtime about the missing
   cCompoundModule class.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Eventlog recording: .elog file format change: message creations and
   duplications (cloning) are now recorded; MC (ModuleCreated) entries now
   precede GC (GateCreated) entries. IMPORTANT: The sequence chart in the
   IDE will only work on .elog files in the new format, existing event logs
   need to be re-recorded!
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Animation Player:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
This is a new component in the IDE, you can access it by right-clicking
   an .elog file and selecting "Open With / OMNeT++ Animation Player" from
   the context menu. This is a preliminary implementation (Technology
   Preview) not yet optimized for large files, the practical maximum file
   size it can handle is about 10MB.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/C++ Development:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added a new "Clean Local" item to the project&#8217;s context menu that does
   not clean referenced projects. This resolves the problem that CDT&#8217;s
   "Clean Project" command also cleans the referenced projects, e.g. if
   you have a Foo project that depends on INET, cleaning Foo also cleans
   INET which takes a long time to recompile. Now you can use the
   "Clean Local" command to clean Foo only.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added new "OMNeT++ Code Formatter" profile. This coding convention follows
   the rules used in the OMNeT++ kernel and the INET Framework. (No tabs, etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added MachO64 binary parsers and error parsers. This makes it possible to
   debug a 64-bit executable on Mac OS X 10.6
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Linux only: Added support for profiling with Valgrind. To activate this
   feature, select "Profile as&#8230; / OMNeT++ Simulation" from the Project
   Explorer context menu. This feature requires Valgrind to be installed
   on your system. (Note: the main IDE toolbar does not show a Profile button
   next to the Run and Debug buttons at this time, but profiling is still
   available via the Project Explorer context menu.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Makemake page in Project Properties can now fix the "Source Folders
   differ across configurations" problem in the project setup, which usually
   occurs when you add a build configuration to an existing project later.
   The dialog now displays a "Fix it" link.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Graphical Editor:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Several performance optimizations for the NED Editor. It can open much larger
   files than before. NED validation is done now in a background thread and
   does not block the UI.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Select 'NED Type Selection' dialog now works correctly on first open. It
   shows the defining projects for the types.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Enhanced drag and drop capabilities in NED Graphical Editor. You can
   drop NED types into a compound module either to create submodules
   (if you drop it into the submodule area), or to turn it into
   an inner type (if you drop on the title of the compound module).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Graphical Editor now displays the file&#8217;s package name at the top.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Graphical Editor displays self-connections as arcs in the module&#8217;s upper
   right corner.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The resize/move feedback figures have been changed from a simple outline
   to translucent blue.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added a 'Properties' dialog that can edit one or several objects
   at a time, and allows you to change graphical and type information.
   It also has a preview panel.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Enhanced editing of type fields in the 'Property View'. The editor correctly
   enumerates the possible choices and adds an import statement if necessary.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
'Open Type' and 'Open Supertype' have been reassigned to the F3 function key.
   Double-click now opens the 'Properties' dialog.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The IDE now uses the use native (C++) layouter code for placing unpinned
   submodules, which means better performance and consistency with the
   simulation runtime (Tkenv).
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Inifile Editor:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Support for inifile improvements in this release, namely multiple section
   inheritance and better parsing for iteration variables
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Performance improvements: inifile is now analyzed in the background so that
   it does not block the UI, and features that need its results (hover text,
   content assist, etc) have a timeout how long they are willing to wait for it
   (see bug #132 for details). It is now also possible to disable inifile
   analysis. Further performance and UI responsiveness improvements are planned.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Sequence Chart:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added 'Go to Simulation Time' and 'Go to Event Number' in the context menu.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
'Go to Simulation Time' in the 'Event Log' view now supports relative values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Sequence Chart tool now knows about message creations and duplications
   (cloning), and as a result, in certain situations it is now able to better
   identify relationships between events and draw a better sequence chart.
   NOTE: Due to changes in the .elog file format, the tool will only work with
   newly recorded files. Existing event logs need to be re-recorded!
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Launcher:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The command-line for launching the simulation now uses relative paths instead
   of absolute ones. This makes the starting command-line easier to understand.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Documentation Generator:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added tilde notation as an alternative to automatic hyperlinking of module
   names in comments. The latter was often too aggressive (e.g. linking to the
   IP module in the phrase "IP address" is wrong). Automatic hyperlinking can
   now be turned off in the generator, and then the user is expected to mark
   words to be hyperlinked with a tilde: "the ~IP module". The INET Framework
   has already been converted to use the tilde notation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added Javascript to autoload frameset page if a content page is opened by
   itself. This is useful when URLs to specific content pages are posted on
   the mailing list or sent over email.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Implemented @include in NED comments. Lines in the included file don&#8217;t have
   to start with "//", but otherwise they are processed exactly as NED comment
   text.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix: External pages (@externalpage) now appear under the "Selected Topics"
   node of the navigation tree in the generated documentation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Several minor fixes: recognize the &lt;u&gt; (underline) HTML tag; sanitize the
   file names for @page; added/refined test cases
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Parallel simulation: Placeholder modules are now displayed with a semi-
   transparent icon (or if it&#8217;s a rectangle or oval, with dotted border).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix (bug #248): compute coordinates (and sizes) in double and not int;
   necessary if background scaling (bgs display string tag) is set up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Better choice of default user interface font, especially on Linux.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The generic UI font and the font used in graphics are now configurable
   in the Simulation Options dialog.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The default font for log text is now proportional (same as the generic UI
   font), for better readability and space efficiency. It can be customized
   (switched back to a monospace font, etc) in the Simulation Options dialog.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Minor: menu items have been changed to title case
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tcl errors are now logged into .tkenvlog instead of dumping them on stdout.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Misc:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added -g option to 'scavetool scalar' command. You can specify how the
   scalars are grouped into columns/variables.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The build system can now build large projects on windows. The 32K command-line
   limitation has been resolved.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Updated base system to Eclipse 3.6.1
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added a detailed IDE change log file doc/IDE-Changes
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
