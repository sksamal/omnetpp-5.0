# This file contains additional input for 'configure'. It is read (sourced)
# during the configuration process. You are free to edit the settings in here.
#
# The settings in this file are all optional in the sense that they all
# have reasonable default values in the configure script.
#

#
# Edit here if you want to use a different compiler from the one autodetected
# by configure. Turns off the compiler autodetection.
#
#CC=gcc
#CXX=g++

#
# Set to "yes" if you want to use clang/clang++ instead of gcc/g++ when both
# compiler is installed.

PREFER_CLANG=yes

#
# Compiler optimization switches. There are two sets of switches,
# and the MODE variable ("debug" or "release") decides which one gets used.
# (Note: For maximum debugging info use switch -ggdb or -gstabs+3 when using gcc and gdb)
# With gcc, do NOT use --omit-frame-pointer (it crashes when coroutines and
# C++ exceptions (throw/catch) are used together)!

# Set to no if you want to create static OMNeT++ libraries. Can be overriden

#
# Compiler and linker options for Tcl/Tk
#
# You can explicitly tell 'configure' which compile switches (TK_CFLAGS)
# and linker switches (TK_LIBS) are needed to build an application with Tcl/Tk.
# Normally these settings are autodetected by 'configure', so you only need to
# edit here if autodetection doesn't work.
#
# With gcc, settings typically look like this:
#
# exaple:TK_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"
# example:TK_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -ltk8.6 -ltcl8.6"
#
# /usr/local/include should be replaced with the directory where tcl.h and tk.h
# live. If they are in two different directories, use two -I switches.
#
# /usr/local/lib should be replaced with the directory that contains the Tcl/Tk
# library files (something like libtcl86.so, libtk8.6.a etc; search for libtcl*
# and libtk* to find them.) The -l options contain the library names: the
# library file names, with the leading 'lib' and trailing '.so*' or '.a*' cut
# off. Sometimes you need to explicitly link with the X11 libraries too, in that
# case add -lX11 to TK_LIBS.
#
# With MinGW I use the following:
# Note that we are using the "bin" directory as the LIB dir.
# i.e. directly linking to the DLLs instead of the importlibs in the "lib" directory.
#
#TK_CFLAGS="-I/c/Tools/Tcl-8.6.0/include"
#TK_LIBS="-L/c/Tools/Tcl-8.6.0/bin -ltk84 -ltcl84"
# or:
#TK_CFLAGS="-I$MSYS/include/tcl8.6"
#TK_LIBS="-L$MSYS/bin -ltk86 -ltcl86"

#
# It is possible to have the Tcl files embedded into the compiled OMNeT++
# libraries and executables. This can be useful if you want to ship
# self-contained standalone executables which do not rely on external
# Tcl scripts. This option is available for Tkenv.
#
EMBED_TCL_CODE=yes

# Select which Qt version you prefer to use.
# Possible values: 4, 5. Any other value will disable building Qtenv
