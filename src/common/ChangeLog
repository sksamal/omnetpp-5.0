2016-03-10  ------ omnetpp-5.0rc released ------

2016-01-18  Andras Varga

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-11-17  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: added femtosecond and attosecond, as they are needed

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp namespace made permanent (cannot be turned off):
	- removed configure option and preprocessor symbol USE_NAMESPACE
	- removed related macros: NAMESPACE_BEGIN, NAMESPACE_END,
	  USING_NAMESPACE, OPP, OPP_STR, OPP_PREFIX etc.

2015-08-10  Attila Torok

	Added the colorutil files with SVG color names, currently used by
	cCanvas and Qtenv.

2015-07-20  ------ omnetpp-5.0b2 released ------

2015-06-30  Andras Varga

	* opp_strnistr() fix (did not match at the end of the string)

2015-06-19  Andras Varga

	* expression.lex: fix #830 "kernel crashes when adding '//' to parameter
	lines in ini-files". The expression parser was not supposed to support
	"//" comments in the first place

2015-06-11  Andras Varga

	* UnitConversion: put back kB/MB/GB/TB with the correct (base 10) meaning.
	Note: base 2 units also exist: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB.

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: longer header guards

2015-06-08  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: code formatting

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* CommonStringPool renamed to StringPool (due to namespaces, it no longer
	conflicts with StringPools in other source folders)

2015-05-15  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use per-folder nested namespaces: omnetpp::envir, omnetpp::tkenv,
	omnetpp::layout, omnetpp::common, omnetpp::eventlog, etc.

2015-05-22  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing: added the 'override' keyword (C++11) to overridden methods;
	it becomes blank when using with an older compiler.

2015-05-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Modernizing: replaced NULLs by 'nullptr' (C++11); it is defined as 0
	when using an older compiler.

2015-04-20  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: use C++ names of C headers (e.g. <cstdio> instead of <stdio.h>)

2015-04-12  Andras Varga

	* Cleanup: copyright years updated

2015-04-08  Andras Varga

	* Modernizing:

	- Use a fixed include path (-Iinclude -Isrc) for all source folders
	  under src/, and qualify cross-folder #includes with the folder
	  name (e.g. change #include "stringutil.h" to #include "common/stringutil.h").
	  This increases readbility and reduces the chance of including a wrong
	  header.

	- In source files, sort #include statements by folder.

2015-03-04  ------ omnetpp-5.0b1 released ------

2015-02-07  Andras Varga

	During development in the 5.0 branch (2013-2014):

	* stringutil.cc/h: new utility functions: opp_strnistr(), opp_urldecode(),
	opp_makedatetimestring(), opp_join()

	* TRACE macro renamed to TRACE_CALL due to conflict with new module logging API

2013-01-09  Andras Varga

	* Renamed methods of cMatchExpression::Matchable:
	    getDefaultAttribute() -> getAsString()
	    getAttribute(const char *name) -> getAsString(const char *attribute)

2012-10-03  Andras Varga

	* fix in Expression: '-2m' was evaluated to '2' (meter was lost)

2012-01-14  Andras Varga

	* MatchExpression: OR operator made optional.
	E.g. now "Host" or "Router" or "Switch" can be written as "Host Router Switch",
	which is more natural at places (code that so far took a space-separated
	list of possible items, like node selectors in INET's configurator,
	can now be naturally extended to have more power by using
	MatchExpression, without affecting existing users or making OR mandatory).

	- several units have been renamed to be more standards compliant:
	  Kbps -> kbps, KB -> KiB, MB -> MiB, GB -> GiB, TB -> TiB;
	- added explanations to "Cannot convert" error messages about the
	renamed units

2011-05-06  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Common library was added in omnetpp-4.0,
	and it contains classes and functions used by all parts of OMNeT++.
