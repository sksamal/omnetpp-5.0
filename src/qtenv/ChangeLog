2016-04-13  Andras Varga

	* Display scheduler info() string on status bar

2016-03-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	* Added markup to config option descriptions

2016-04-01  Mihaly Palenik

	* Added tooltip to timeline messages
	* Added tooltips to Preferences dialog and Find Objects dialog
	* Deactivated dummy GateInspector
	* GenericObjectInspector not to open a new window when double-clicking
	  on an object

2016-04-01  Andras Varga

	* osg: fix: earth scenes did not display in the osg-intro sample

	Root cause: zNear/zFar was not set explicitly in these demos, so it stuck
	with the default values in cOsgCanvas: 1 and 1000.  This caused basically
	all of the scene to be clipped away (out of z range).

	Solution: cOsgCanvas does NOT contain any zNear/zFar by default, only
	when explicitly set. In the viewer, activate near/far autocompute mode
	when cOsgCanvas has no zNear/zFar, otherwise set DO_NOT_COMPUTE_NEAR_FAR.

	Adjusting the aspect ratio in OsgViewer::resizeEvent() is not needed when
	setProjectionResizePolicy(HORIZONTAL) is set.

2016-03-11  Mihaly Palenik

	* Set margin on layout of simTimeLabel and eventNumLabel

2016-03-11  Mihaly Palenik

	* Add tooltips to status

2016-03-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* osg: Following the changing osgEarth::Viewpoint API.

2016-03-21  Andras Varga

	* "#undef emit" no longer needed in simkerneldefs.h

2016-03-21  Andras Varga

	* Fix: clear componentHistory between runs

2016-03-10  ------ omnetpp-5.0rc released ------

2016-02-29  Levente Meszaros

	* Changed the background color of the simtime and eventnum labels to
	white.

2016-02-28  Attila Torok

	* StopDialog default position is under the floating toolbar. And its
	  geometry can easily be made persistent.
	* Toolbar event status appearance modified. (layout, frame, font size)
	* Renamed .qtenv.ini to .qtenvrc.

2016-02-26  Mihaly Palenik

	* Follow recent Tkenv changes

2016-02-22  Andras Varga

	* Added fields to the toolbar that display the *current* simulation time
	and event number. Refactored the status bars, and added a status line at
	the bottom. The status bar displays the simulation time of the next event
	along with the difference from the last event. Moved network description
	and message info to the new status line.

	* With the recent simulation kernel changes, printEventBanner() needs to be
	called inside simulationEvent() so that it prints the correct (updated)
	simulation time and event number.

	* When animating, updateStatusDisplay() also needs to be called in
	simulationEvent() so that the correct (updated) simulation time is displayed
	during the animation.

2016-02-14  Attila Torok

	* GenericObjectInspector works with Qt5 now.
	* Added load(moc) to qtenv.pro.
	* Added Qt version information to the About dialog.
	* Fixed crashes when compiled without OSG.
	* Resolved issues with config and run selection from .ini, args and dialog.
	* Small changes to make the code compile with Qt5.
	* Undo wrong fix for run until message, apply correct one. Oops.
	* osg: Switching between camera manipulators doesn't reset the viewpoint
	  anymore.

2016-02-10  Attila Torok

	* logging: LogLevel of Components can be changed, and is saved/restored.
	* Also a small fix regarding switching of run modes.
	* Separate inspector preferences for toplevel and embedded inspectors.
	  The toplevel inspectors will default to the prefs of the embedded ones
	  if they don't have their own values.
	* Restored StopDialog button font size.
	* Context menu in LogInspector for messages, express run until message fixed.

2016-02-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* ColorizeEffect fixed, image figures use it now, zoomLabel painting
	fixed, other small corrections.

2016-02-08  Attila Torok

	* CompoundModuleItem: Border now takes width and height independently
	  from the bgb tag.
	* Correct status display when single stepping.

2016-02-04  Attila Torok

	* Style and layout fixes and adjustments (some are Mac-specific).

2016-02-03  Rudolf Hornig

	* osgEarth: made it compile with osgEarth 2.7 (in Fedora 23).

2016-02-01  Attila Torok

	* Inspector preferences.
	* Multiple ModuleInspectors in OSG mode should work better.
	* Closing the StopDialog in Express mode stops the simulation.
	* Double-clicking on a cObjectNode in the OSG canvas sets the object
	  to be inspected.

2016-01-27  Attila Torok

	* GenericObjectInspector: The default mode for container-like objects
	is now children. Scrolling fixed yet again. Context menu on green
	background.

2016-01-27  Levente Meszaros

	* OSG: Added call to setComputeNearFarMode() to prevent automatically
	updating zNear and zFar.

2016-01-20  Attila Torok

	* Fixed the interpolation mode of pixmap figures.
	* The zoom label on the module canvas uses the canvas font now.
	* Added hasChildren() to GenericObjectTreeModel. This should make it
	  a bit faster in some cases.

2016-01-13  Attila Torok

	* Double confirmation dialog on Ctrl+Q fixed.
	* ModuleCanvasViewer: Scroll region correction and figure rendering fixes.
	* ModuleCanvasViewer now redraws the compound module upon refresh.
	* Context menu positions corrected.
	* Fixes and improvements to figure and arrowhead rendering.

2016-01-08  Attila Torok

	* Minor corrections in ConnectionItem and OutlinedTextItem.
	* textviewerwidget: Another improvement to scrollbar handling.
	* submoduleitem: Icons are no longer colored if the weight is an empty string.
	* fileeditor: Changed the handling of QActions, F3 works now.
	* Flip window layout action fixed.
	* Implemented Qtenv::askyesno().
	* Splitter ratio now correctly saved and restored in both orientations.
	* Fixed a few compiler warnings here and there.
	* Increase/Decrease icon size shortcuts now work, fixed crashes when
	  no network is set up.

2015-12-07  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed a build error on Windows

2015-12-03  Rudolf Hornig

	* A workaround for a bug where the floating toolbar was not properly
	refreshed on MAC OS X when the inspector window was scrolled.
	Right now we are putting the toolbar above the window on MAC OS X. We
	could switch back to floating toolbar once the refresh issue is solved.

2015-12-07  ------ omnetpp-5.0b3 released ------

2015-12-02  Andras Varga

	* Qtenv is ready for the OMNeT++ 5.0 beta 3 release.

	Most of Qtenv was implemented by Attila Torok and Mihaly Palenik
	between April and August 2015, using Tkenv code as scaffolding.
	It was then refined by them during fall 2015.

	OpenSceneGraph integration was mostly coded by Andras Varga.
	The build system is largely the work of Rudolf Hornig.

2015-04-21  Andras Varga

	* Qtenv: Added defunct Tkenv code as scaffolding for the code.
	(Tcl_VarEval() and other Tcl API functions have been replaced with
	dummy functions, so the original Tkenv code compiles but does
	nothing for the moment.)

2015-03-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* Qtenv development started: Initial Qt code by Attila Torok.
