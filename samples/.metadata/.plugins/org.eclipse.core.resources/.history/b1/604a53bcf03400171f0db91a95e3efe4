package obsmodules.src.EdgeNode;

//
// Implements a signalling protocol and sends the burst to the first channel available.
//
//   This method can receive two kinds of messages: optical bursts generated by any burstifier or a self-messsage identified by its kind number (see enum). The self-message has a control info object which contains some useful info for the sender such as burst's assigned lambda, burst identifier in scheduledBurst queue, etc.
//   First of all, this method checks the class of message it receives: if it's an optical burst, looks for the data channel (lambda) with the smallest horizon. Then, creates a OBS_BurstSenderInfo, fills it and sends it yourself in order to schedule the BCP sending. Also, stores the burst into scheduledBurst list with an estimated send time (but if scheduledBurst list is limited with maxSchedBurstSize or maxSchedBurstElems, burst will be dropped and deleted when scheduledBurst is full) . At this point, two cases could happen scheduling iniBCP transmission:
//
//   - Data channel is free on current simTime + maxOffset, so the BCP can be sent right now.
//   - It must wait a time until data channel is free, so it needs to delay the BCP sending until maxOffset time before burst transmission.
//
//Once the iniBCP is scheduled, the process continues when this method receives a self-message. Each self-message kind represents a step on a sequence of message sending: first, the BCP begin is sent. After that, a time after (depending on the data rate and size of the message), sends the BCP end message and schedules the burst transmission using the time estimated at the beginning. Finally, once the burst beginning is sent, schedules the burst end using data rate and burst size.
