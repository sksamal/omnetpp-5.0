DispatcherTest
==============

This network just tests if OBS_PacketDispatcher works. All traffic generated by generator is redirected to one of the sinks available.

SETTINGS:

Dispatcher's criteria is defined in DispatcherRules.dat (another file name can be set in omnetpp.ini). This file have this format:

<ruleId> <value> ([and] <ruleId> <value>)*\n

where ruleId could be:

* srcAddr : Source IP Address
* destAddr : Destination IP Address
* protocol : Transport Protocol (according to IP header)
* srcPort : Source TCP/UDP Port
* destPort : Destination TCP/UDP Port

You must define the number of rules entered in this file using the parameter numQueues in omnetpp.ini. (if not, the application might crash).
